### Data Understanding
##### 1. Overall data: Check how many data and columns are in the data set to see if we can handle them all in a reasonable process time
##### 2. Column data type: Check numerical or categorical. As needed change the data type to the appropriate ones
##### 3. Data contents: Check null data existence and decide either to remove them or fill them out with alternate data
##### 4. Column price dependency: Identify no price dependency columns and eliminate them
##### 5. Column selection: Check how many columns are in the data set and what columns we should keep or drop
##### 6. Data review: Check price distribution and counts by each column
##### 7. Data integrity: Remove unreasonable outliners so the data analysis result will not be distorted
